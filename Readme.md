# EventManager

  Higher level event management designed to facilitate fluent
  domain-specific event subscriptions.

  For example [component/events](https://github.com/component/events)
  uses `EventManager` to provide fluent dom node event subsciptions,
  while [component/delegates](https://github.com/component/delegates)
  does the same, however for delegated events.

  You can think of this as the "Event Emitter" of the abstract event mechanism.
